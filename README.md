# Plant Monitoring Device

This is a device that can monitor the soil moisture and amount of light for a plant.


## Summary

Here, write a paragraph or two describing what you built for your final project and what was challenging. 

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

For this project, Jamie Catacutan and I wanted to create a device that would help with taking care of plants. Initially we wanted to use a screen to display the different areas to be monitored (moisture, light and temperature), but we spent a lot of time and couldn't figure out how to get the screens to work. Instead, we used a Neopixel Stick to indicate soil moisture and temperature levels, and a switch to toggle between the two levels on the Stick.

We used two nails as moisture sensors and a light sensor. The two nails are to be placed into soil to measure the moisture, which will be displayed on the Neopixel Stick via blue light; the bar is completely lit if there is enough water, and depletes if there is not enough. The light sensor picks up the amount of light for the surrounding area, and is indicated on the Neopixel Stick via green to yellow light in the same manner.

## Component Parts

From what pieces did you build your project?

We used an Adafruit Feather 32u4, two breadboards, two nails, one light sensor, one switch and one Neopixel Stick.

The input data includes moisture value from the nails and light value from the light sensors, as well as the value of the switch for the Neopixel Stick.

The output data include the code and the light levels indicated on the Stick.
